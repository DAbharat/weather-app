# 🌦️ Weather App — Tailwind CSS Project

This is a simple, responsive weather application I built as a **beginner project** to explore and practice **Tailwind CSS** and **JavaScript**. The app fetches live weather data for any searched city and displays useful metrics like temperature, humidity, sunrise time, wind, and more — all styled with Tailwind utility classes.
